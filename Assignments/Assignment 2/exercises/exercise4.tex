\section{A partially ordered set $D$ is a complete lattice if every subset S of D has a least upper bound $\sqcup S$. Show that in a complete lattice $D$, an element $e$ is compact if and only if for all $S \subseteq D$: $e \leq \sqcup S$ implies $e \leq \sqcup X$ for some finite $X \subseteq S$.}
%$S$ can either be infinite or finite. In case of a finite set,
